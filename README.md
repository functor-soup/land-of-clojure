#Unofficial Translation of Common lisp code from Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp Book, into Clojure

The book itself is my favourite book of all time. I wish I were the one who wrote the book and the code but alas it is __Conrad Barski__ who wrote the code and I am just a layman who translated it for fun.

# This is a project done for fun. Any criticism or snobbish comments in the code is just me being an idiot.
